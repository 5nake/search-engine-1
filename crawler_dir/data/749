<p>
 I am looking for a sharp graduate to join <a href="people.html">my team</a>
 as a postdoc, in fall 2012.  The postdoc would be a fellow of the

healthcare information systems; in particular, my group is working on
secure methods for use of mobile computing and wearable sensors in the
context of healthcare (mHealth).
See our <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/papers/index.html#mhealth">recent
papers</a>.
As such, the postdoc would join an inter-disciplinary team
working on four funded projects, primarily from NSF 
(<a href="http://www.ists.dartmouth.edu/projects/tish.html">Trustworthy Information Systems for Healthcare (TISH)</a>)
and HHS (<a href="http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=1806&mode=2">Strategic Healthcare Information Technology Advanced Research
Projects on Security</a> (<a href="sharps.org">SHARPS</a>)).

The candidate must have finished his or her Ph.D in Computer Science
or Computer Engineering, have deep experience with networks, security,
or privacy, have experience planning and conducting experimental
computer systems research, and be an excellent programmer. Ideal
candidates will also have experience with mobile computing, sensor
