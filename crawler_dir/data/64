Dear students:

Welcome to the CS 106 mailing list! Any of you can use this list to send
email to the entire class. Feel free to discuss class-related material
on this list. The address is <cs106-F10@cs.dartmouth.edu>.

An announcement: tomorrow (Wednesday) would normally have been our first
lecture, but due to a scheduling conflict, I have to postpone this to
Thursday's X-hour.  Those new to Dartmouth should knnow that every
course has a designated X-hour.  Ours is on Thursdays, from 1:00 to
1:50, and I ask that you keep that hour free, because we will
occasionally use it.

See you all on Thursday, at 1:00pm, in Sudikoff 214. I am looking
forward to a great term!

Content-Length: 1376
Lines: 32

Hi all:  The first homework set has been posted to the course website. Let me
stress that this homework is meant to be review, and to get you used to flexing
your linear algebra muscles (which may have lain dormant for a while). ***You
should not be struggling to complete this.*** If you find yourself struggling,
please consider taking a linear algebra course before returning to CS 106. 

As I said in class, this is due before next Wednesday's class (unless an
exception arises, homework will be due before each Wednesday class).

For those who registered late, here is what I had sent to the list earlier.

Hi all:  Just a quick note to say that I've updated the course website a
bit, including a "course diary" where I will post one-line summaries of
topics covered in each lecture. Also, office hours are announced and the
grading formula is made explicit. Once again, the course website is at

	http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs106

but of course you knew that, since you've done the homework, right?

I hope to introduce our TA, Hao Luo, on Monday. He's on this email list
as well. (Hao, can you please stop by for a couple of minutes at the
start of Monday's class?)

Hi all:

As of today, there are 11 students registered for the course. We are
past the basic add/drop period, so I assume these 11 will constitute the
class for this term.

Three of you had registered somewhat late and weren't on the mailing
list, until just now. Sorry! Please catch up with what you missed by
going through the CS106 mailing list archive, here:
	http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac/Teach/CS106-Fall10/MailArchive/mails.html
	(access is Dartmouth-only; also linked from course website)

Finally, the mailing list includes several students who aren't
registered for the course any more. **I will be removing them from the
list by Wednesday unless I hear from them otherwise.** So, if this
applies to you, and you want to stay on the list, please write back.

Content-Length: 696
Lines: 19

Hi all:

The short message is that I will have a special session for CS 106,
during the X-hour (1:00 - 2:50 pm) tomorrow. 

I will try to keep it brief. The agenda is:

(1) Talk about computational cost analysis of the algorithms we have
seen so far (Gram-Schmidt, Householder, and a bit about least squares).
You'll need to do some similar analysis for HW3, and although this
material is easy to pick up (after all, you've all done an Algorithms
class), it's best that I do it in class once, formally.

(2) Distribute sample solutions to HW2, and answer any questions you may
have about the homework so far.

Feel free to stay for only part (1); that shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.

Hi, folks,

In Question 10 of hw2, some of you didn't get 10 points because I  
thought you didn't have enough reasoning on how to get U, the  
eigenvectors. But if you did find the correct U and verify it through  
some computation, please let me know, I'd like to add the points for  
you.

Regards,

Hao

Hi all:  I have put a bare-bones version of HW 4 online, on the course

again when that's ready.  

But you can certainly start thinking about the homework. Rest assured,
no drastic changes will occur.

Subject: Important announcement about the CS 106 Midterm
Content-Length: 1109
Lines: 27

Hi, all:

The CS 106 midterm will be held in class, starting at 

	1:00pm on Thu Oct 28 (i.e., the X-hour).

The exam will be designed to be finishable within the X-hour, but I
don't want it to be all about speed-solving, so the submission deadline
will be 3:00pm on the same day. This will be a written exam; you won't
need to use a computer (and in fact, you are not allowed to).

The honor code principle applies to this exam as follows. The exam is
closed-book and closed-notes, EXCEPT that you are allowed a "cheat
sheet". This should consist of a single sheet of LETTER PAPER.  You can
write (or print, using a printer) whatever you want on both sides of the
sheet. Preparing this cheat sheet should be done entirely on your own,
and you are not allowed to share any portion of your cheat sheet with
others.

The syllabus for the exam consists of Lectures 1 through 19 of the textbook.

Please contact me ASAP if you have any questions. Thanks,

-Amit

rather than Wednesday. (So you still have a week to work on it.)
