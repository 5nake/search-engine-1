Computer security aims to ensure only "good" behavior happens in computer systems, despite potential action by malicious adversaries.
Consequently, the field has focused primarily on
the technology to prohibit "bad things," according to some set of rules,
and to a lesser extent on the structure of such rules.
<p>
Unfortunately, 
fieldwork and anecdotes report 
how we keep getting the rules "wrong."   
<p>
Interestingly, 
<i>the 
computer security
field has largely ignored the process by which humans
produce these sets of rules.</i>  
However, psychology
and related disciplines can tell us a lot about such processes---including 
ways the human mind systematically misperceives things
when making evaluations and judgments.
In this research seminar course, we will examine 
whether systematic flaws in how humans produce these rule sets 
lie at the core of real-world security frustration----and whether
we can use these insights to improve the situation.
<p>
The course will draw on IT security issues in 
real-world domains including finance, healthcare, power.
