<li>
1998 Alessandra Fadel late medieval/renaissance six course lute.<br>
Lowest two courses are single strung- highest course is double string.  
The lute will need a neck reset to be playable due to high action.
A few different luthiers have verified that the problem is fixable, and I'm subtracting the estimated repair fees from the price.<br>
Includes a new Kingham case.  $1400 negotiable.<br>

13 course lute. Nico van der Waals 1985.<br>
It is a very special instrument made by one of the most experienced European makers.
This lute purchased and later almost never played by previous owner so it  is in great condition.
It has nice action, flawless soundboard made of really great piece of spruce. The instrument has a beautiful tone and obviously would work with any types of strings. We bought it of pure nostalgic feelings since most of great recordings in the 20 cent. were made on this type of a lute by Nico van der Waals. We are selling it for pure financial reason, and also we did not use it much since we stick to our basic instruments and to have an extra one is too much of a luxury
Please feel free to ask more questions and maybe ask for more pictures.
price 4900 EUR<br>
Warmest wishes, Anna Kowalska & Anton Birula<br>

Original 1827 Louis Panormo “Panormo Fecit” guitar, completely restored in my workshop this year.<br>
The body, in excellent condition, is of beautiful figured maple and the finish is golden brown. I’m afraid the photos do not do it justice. It is strung with Savarez White Card strings and plays wonderfully. It comes with a small vintage fibre case.<br>

Hamburger Cithrinchen after Tielke<br>
Built in 2012 by Heico Kilian. Current tuning is similar to a baroque 
guitar in a (d(d=92)/g(g=92)/bb/e=92e=92/a=92a=92). There is also 
evidence for other more cittern-like tunings. I bought it as a higher 
supplement to my theorbo, but I'd now want to sell it due to money 
reasons.<br>

- 5 courses, double or single<br>
- New, hardly played<br>
- Nice clear sound, good playability<br>
- Equal temperament<br>
- String length: 36,4 cm<br>
- Nice dragon head at the top<br>
- Some replacement strings for re-entrant tuning are included<br>
- Parchment rosettes and nice ornaments<br>
- Comes with padded bag<br>
- Selling price: &euro; 1.900,- (without shipping, tax or other costs)<br>

The Hamburger Cithrinchen was fashionable between about 1650 and 1750. A 
good desciption (in German) can be found here: <br>

lute case by Pierre Rousseau (100% NEW, never used), made in October 2012, Paris, France.<br>
These lute cases are the most light ones on the market (about 2kl less weight then a Kingham Case), they are extremely robust (made with the same aluminum used for Airplanes), and they look refined and gorgeous too ! 
Size : made for a Renaissance luth of 67 cm. But it suits perfectly any renaissance lute from 65 to 67 cm (it is very easy to adjust the foam on the back for smaller lutes).
Specially built with a music Score compartment on the top (this is an unique feature for this one time made case model)! 
It was also built in order to have the possibility to cary the lute on the back (very useful when traveling by train or plane). <br>
Price : 500&euro; (this is a special price, since the Scores special feature on this model is not being taking in account).<br>
The case can be sent anywherein the World with FedEX (price not included).<br>

 This guitar has been restored to excellent museum quality condition.

6 course Hirotaka Watanabe lute.<br>
It's an amazing instrument. 6 courses, 61cm. I've been told the body is a copy of the
Gerle lutes. It has a fat, short body and plays wonderfully. I'm
looking into a baroque lute so it's time to let this one go. I'd be
happy to
   consider trades.  $4000.00 or best offer plus shipping charges.  The case is a
crate made by the builder.  Its has velcro straps to secure the lute on one
   side and straps that can hold a soprano lute, renaissance guitar or cittern of the side. Very handy case!<br>
The lute is located in Baltimore MD.<br>

LUTE/THEORBO CASES for sale:<br>
I have duplicate cases for various instruments of mine (some lighter, some stronger, for varying travel conditions) and, due to a combination conjugal pressure and the restraints of a 30 square metre Paris flat, I have decided to put the lot on sale, sell the ones that go and keep the ones that don't. They are:
<br>
1 - ultra lightweight SOMA case for a huge theorbo (weighs less than a kilo). Made in 2010. Good condition. 600 Euros obo.
<br>
2 - ultra lightweight SOMA lute cases, one for a Renaissance lute, one for a rider 13c lute. Made in 2010. Perfect condition. 500 euros each, obo.
<br>
3 - grey Kingham case, with the extra lightweight cloth that they don't offer anymore (it used to cost 40% extra; this is much lighter than the normal lightweight material they offer on their site). Made in 2006. Perfect condition. 800 euros obo.

For sale is my 1983 Klaus Jacobsen theorbo, 77 cm/145 cm, 14 courses<br>
This instrument is loacted in El Cerrito, near Berkeley, California <br>
super fine grained Spruce top, of the type you never see anymore <br>
Multirib bookmatched rosewood, of the type you would rarely see back then.  <br>
This is an older instrument, and has some wear and tear, but has many deluxe features in the details and purflings, the shape of the neck, and so on.  <br>
Comes with the original Paxman case, which is still fine.  <br>
I would rate this instrument in the top three of any theorbo I ever played as far as sound goes, it is, however, a lute like sound, as opposed to a guitar like sound.  <br>
Carries very well in large halls, no doubt about it.
Used on many recordings.
Please do not ask for an MP3. This instrument will be sold to someone who appreciates it; it is not a mail-order spouse.  <br>
Price is &euro; 5000, firm. Serious enquiries only, please.  <br>

13-course lute after 18th century German models, made by Clive Titmuss in 2009. <br>

This lute is intended for playing the music of Weiss and Bach, designed after models
by Sebastian Schelle and Johann Christian Hoffman. The 9 rib back is made from
high-quality figured European maple, finished with oil varnish. The top is
a superb piece of German spruce, with a rose by Schelle. The 
pegbox is triple-laminated from ebony and holly. The pegs are copied from
Hofmann, made from lilac, a beautiful and rare wood. The neck is veneered in
quarter-sawn Brazilian rosewood.  There is a substantial moulded ebony
binding applied to the side which allows for playing at a table and less
stress on the right forearm.  It comes with a fitted, lined, reinforced
case with brass hardware.  It is an ultra-high quality instrument. More
photos and sound samples are posted on my website:

Six course lute for sale, built in 1997 by Cezar Mateus and rebuilt by the maker last year.<br>
59.5 cm string length.
Birdseye maple body, neck and pegbox. Spruce soundboard.
It has slightly fluted ribs, and reddish varnish (as seen in iconography)
The material used for the back is very rare and difficult to find these days.<br>

This is quite an extraordinary looking and sounding lute.  After 12 years of being played, Mr. Mateus replaced its soundboard and renewed it completely.
I'm selling it because I simply don't play it too much, and I think it deserves more dedication.<br>

Price: 3900 euros Kingham case included.<br>

6 course lute in G by Paul Thomson 1983.<br>
This is a magnificent sounding
instrument with a particularly beautiful Birdseye maple body. The tuning
length is 60cm and the lute is strung in nylgut with wound bass and comes
with Paxman case. The overall condition is consistent with an instrument of
this age. There is a fine crack in the bottom of the soundboard, which has
remained the same for many years and Paul's advice is to leave it well
alone.<br>

7-course lute by Martin Haycock for sale<br>

I am offering a wonderfully sounding seven-course version after the Georg Gerle lute at the Vienna Kunsthistorisches Museum for sale. The instrument was finished in February 2010 and   has a birds-eye maple back and an ebony veneered neck and pegbox. The pegs are made from a very hard kind of pear-wood. The state of the instrument is as good as new. It comes with a fitted Kingham case with the more luxurious and expensive navy blue velvet lining (also in as new condition).<br>

The sound is very characteristic of Martin Haycock’s work. Lots of projection, balance and great definition of voices when playing polyphony as well as a beautifully refined tone.<br>

You may wonder why I am selling it instead of keeping it for myself. The reason being that I am making my own instruments for some time now and I finally managed to make a seven-course that meets my professional expectations. The instrument can be seem and tried in Amsterdam (The Netherlands).<br>

Wanted 10 course lute, small archlute or Liuto Attiobatto:
 
I am a luthier specializing in reproductions of Early Romantic Guitars (19th century), an avid lute player (but I don’t make them) and I am offering to trade a reproduction Early Romantic Guitar for a 10 course Renaissance Lute.<br>
My preference for a 10 course lute is a larger body like Magno Tieffenbrucher, string length 64cm - 66cm. The smaller bodies like Frei I find too small so as much as I like their design I find it uncomfortable to play them.<br>
If you have a smaller (shorter string length basses) archlute or a Liuto Attiobatto I will seriously consider those as well.<br>
I am offering a choice of instruments I have in stock or to build a new instrument from my catalog list depending on the quality/condition of the lute available and what fits our mutual satisfaction. See my web site www.roseberryguitars.com to see examples of the instruments I build.<br>

I'd like to buy a theorbo.  Best if I can try it.  I'll drive 
anywhere between Washington D.C. and Boston.
I'd like to find something for around $3000.
I would buy one from abroad if I could be sure that the instrument is decent.

Stolen lute. The lute in
  question belongs to Marianne Buisseret, Hofstraat 247, 9000 Ghent, Belgium
  (tel: 00 32 9225 9576 contact email: lieven.misschaert@worldonline.be) and
  was recently stolen in Belgium from a lute maker's car. It was on its way to
  be cleaned up so it won't look as pristine as in the photographs, which were
  taken when it was made in 1984.

I'm writing to ask that everyone be on the lookout for a baroque guitar (5
courses) belonging to Lucas Harris in NY.
It was left accidently on the Long Island Rail Road and was taken by someone
on the train. 
It has snakewood back and sides, a red and white rose with the center part
missing so you can actually see the label, which says Ivo Romano 1996, I
believe.  It has a vaulted back.<br>

<a name="howto"></a><h3>How to post an ad</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Send your postings for lutes for sale, or lutes wanted, to
wbc&#64;cs&#046;dartmouth&#046;edu and be sure to include your city or state (including
country) so people know where the lute is, and phone number if you want people to 
contact you by phone.
You also must include an e-mail address where I can reach you.
Please send your ad in plain text format, not in html format!
I generally do not reply to you unless I need more information
but
I try and insert and delete ads as soon as I get them.  
I will delete the ads after roughly one year.
<li>
If you send pictures, try and crop them close to the instrument so people don't
have to wait to download extra picture that they don't need.  
A 200,000 byte picture will take over thirty seconds to download
on a modem connection!
Be sure the pictures are in focus.  Take a few moments to check
in detail.  
Cameras focus better in bright light, so consider taking your
pictures outdoors.
Look at what is in the background of the picture too!
You might not want your dirty laundry in the picture.
It helps if the
names of the pictures don't have any spaces in them.  Use
"baroque-lute.jpg" or "baroqueLute.jpg" instead of "baroque lute.jpg".
If you take a close up picture of the rosette be sure that it is in focus.
<li>
If you are not writing in english, please either use html characters
for accents ( as &amp;eacute;  for &eacute;) or spell it out ( o with " over it, &ouml; )
or use tex symbols ( \'a, &aacute; ) as my word processor does not
recognise accents.  Since I post these ads in my very hard to
come by free moments, it would help me if you send the ad as
"text/plain" format.  If I can't read your ad I will ask you
to re-submit it.
<li> 
If you want to change something, please send me the changes, not the whole ad.
If you say "change the price from 4500 to 4200" or "add a line
that says  ..." I can quickly make the change.  If you send me
a new ad I have to look through the new and old versions to find
the differences, and I may miss something.  If I already have the pictures
please don't send them again!
<li>
I have a very hard time decoding Microsoft Word documents - please send your ad as plain text!
<li>
Please type out the monitary units, as in "yen", "krone", "euro",
or "dollars" as my computer can't read the special symbols that many
people use for money.  If you type in the characters &#38;yen&#59;
you will get a &yen;, and the characters &#38;euro&#59; will 
print &euro;.  The &#38; (ampersand) and &#59; (semicolon) are 
required.  ( if your are british &#38;#163; or &#38;pound; {include the semicolon} will produce the &#163; sign.)
<li>
I use spam filters, if you message looks a lot like spam (html format, 
all capital letters, etc) I may not get it.  If the ad doesn't show up try sending 
it again using plain text, lowercase letters, and a Subject that says
"lute for sale" clearly.
<li>
If you are a professional builder you may list lutes that you currently
have on hand for immediate sale.  Please tell me when the instrument
is sold.
<a name="string"></a>
<li>
This service is free, but if you feel grateful to me for having
found or sold your lute, you can send a 
<a href="payment.html">contribution</a> to
Wayne Cripps, 6211 Sudikoff Lab., Hanover, N.H. 03755 USA.
Please make checks payable to "Wayne Cripps", as the bank gets
upset when I try to cash checks made out to "string fund."
Foreign currencies (cash, not checks) are gladly accepted.
(I seem to be collecting euros now.)
<li>
I tend to change usage to American English without notification.
<li>
Send any questions about the instruments listed here directly 
to the owners.  In some cases, the owners do not have e-mail and
you will have to use the phone or even write to them!
<li>
Please be sure to tell me if you do not want me to list your complete name and
address information.  
It is helpful if people know what country and state the instrument
is in, but it might be safer to omit your street address. 
You should check your ad once I have inserted it.
You might want to consider opening a special email account 
for selling your lute, as you will get mail from Nigerian 
criminals.  It may take a year to sell your lute, and you may
be getting several Nigerian Scam messages a day!
You will also get a lot of mail from other people who want to take your money!
</ul>
<a name="fraud"></a>
<h4>Warning! the Nigerian Fraud has hit the lute world! </h4>
Criminals from Nigeria are contacting people who advertise on this list,
asking to buy a lute with a check for thousands of dollars over
the price of the
lute and have the seller wire the remaining money to Nigeria.
Don't do it - the check will be forged and will bounce -
this is a way to steal your money!   They all seem to know about this 
"Lutes for Sale" list and they <em>will</em> contact you.

You may want to get yourself a temporary email address to use just for
selling your lute, so that your regular email is not filled with
messages from people running this scam.
<p>
Here are some signs of fraud:
<ul>
<li>If someone wants to send a check for more than the cost of the instrument and shipping, and wants you to send cash back to them with the instrument for "tax reasons".  The check will bounce and you will be out the money and your instrument.  Even if the bank accepts the check, they will come after you for the money weeks later when they find it is forged.
<li>If someone will deliver a check by courier.  In the USA mail fraud is a serious crime and  thieves use FedEx and Western Union so they won't be investigated and prosecuted by the Post Service.
<li>Watch out for forged bank checks.  If you are suspicious wait a few weeks to be sure that it clears.  Talk to someone at your bank about this.
<li>If someone is buying a lute for somebody else as a present.  Perhaps 
a rich uncle buying something for his nephew.  Or perhaps the person
is acting as an agent.  How many lute players would have an agent
buy a lute for them?  Really!  (watch out for "Mark Luke")
<li>If a third party, not the buyer, is supposed to send the check because
he owes the buyer money.
<li>If someone doesn't ask the usual lute player questions about the age, condition,
and string dimensions, and doesn't ask for pictures.  If someone says
they saw your lute and it is acceptable.  If they don't even mention
lutes, but just ask for information about the article you are selling.
<li>If someone seems to have difficulty writing the language of the
country they claim to come from.
<li>Check the person out on google!  Do they have a lute page or are there complaints about them selligng motorcycles that they don't own?
<li>Note also that Indonesia is known for credit card fraud.  Be extremely
cautious when selling something to be paid for with an Indonesian card!
