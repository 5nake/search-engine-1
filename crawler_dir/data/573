  <h3> CS 106 (Fall 2010) </h3>

  <h3> Midterm Exam </h3>

  <p> The CS 106 midterm will be held in class, starting at <span
  style="color:red">1:00pm on Thu Oct 28 (i.e., the X-hour)</span>. </p>

  <p> The exam will be designed to be finishable within the X-hour, but it is not
  about speed-solving, so the submission deadline will be 3:00pm on the same day.
  This will be a written exam; you won't need to use a computer (and in fact, you
  are not allowed to). </p>

  <h3> Honor Code </h3>

  <p> The honor code principle applies to this exam as follows. The exam is
  closed-book and closed-notes, <b>except</b> that you are allowed a "cheat
  sheet". This should consist of a single sheet of <b>letter paper</b>.  You can
  write (or print, using a printer) whatever you want on both sides of the sheet.
  Preparing this cheat sheet should be done entirely on your own, and you are not
  allowed to share any portion of your cheat sheet with others. </p>

  <h3> Syllabus </h3>

  <p> The syllabus for the exam consists of Lectures 1 through 19 of the textbook. </p>
