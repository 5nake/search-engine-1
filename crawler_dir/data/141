<h1>Installing Eclipse on Mac OS X</h1>

This page tells you how to download Eclipse for Mac OS X, install it,
and configure it so that it looks like how I use it.  If you need

<h2>How to download and install Eclipse</h2>

<ol>
  
  <li> Go to <a
       href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>
       to download a copy of eclipse.  The page will look like
       this:
       
       <p>
       <img src="EclipseDownloads.jpg">
       <p>

       The first item listed is "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (98
       MB)."  On the right is a green, downward-pointing arrow.  Next
       to that are links labeled "Mac OS X 32 Bit" and "Mac OS X 64
       Bit."  Click on the "Mac OS X 32 Bit" link.  (Even if you have
       nice, new 64-bit Mac, it should run the 32-bit version just
       fine.)
       
       <p>

  <li> You will see a window like this:
       
       <p>
       <img src="EclipseMirror.jpg">
       <p>

       (The location next to the green, downward-pointing arrow might
       not be Virginia Tech, but that's OK.  And the "Get It Faster
       Here" locations might be different, but that doesn't matter,
       either.)  Click on the green, downward pointing arrow.  A
       download of eclipse-java-helios-SR2-macosx-cocoa.tar.gz will
       start.  If you first get a window like this
       
       <p>
       <img src="OpeningTar.jpg">
       <p>

       just click "OK" so that the downloaded file opens with Archive
       Utility.

       <p>

  <li> The download will go to your Downloads folder.  You will
       normally have an icon for the Downloads folder on the
       right-hand side of the dock.  Find
       eclipse-java-helios-SR2-macosx-cocoa.tar.gz in your Downloads
       folder, and drag it to the Desktop.  Then double-click it.  You
       will see a folder named "eclipse."
       
       <p>

  <li> Drag the "eclipse" folder into your Applications folder.  The
       easiest way to do so is to open a new window in the Finder and
       click on Applications in the list you get on the left-hand
       side.  Then drag the "eclipse" folder in with the other
       applications.  Make sure that you do <em>not</em> drag it into
       a folder that's already within Applications.  In other words,
       when you're done, the Applications folder should have directly
       within it a folder named "eclipse."

       <p>

  <li> (This step is not required, but it's strongly recommended.)
       Double click the "eclipse" folder.  You'll see an application
       named "Eclipse"; it has a purple icon with white horizontal
       stripes.  Drag it into your dock.  Now you will be able to
       launch Eclipse by clicking on the icon in the dock.
       
       <p>

  <li> You may now drag eclipse-java-helios-SR2-macosx-cocoa.tar.gz to
       the Trash.  Empty the Trash whenever you wish.
       
       <p>

  <li> When you launch Eclipse for the first time, you'll be asked
       "'Eclipse' is an application downloaded from the Internet.  Are
       you sure you want to open it?"  Click "Open."
       
       <p>

  <li> You'll see something like the following window:
       
       <p>
       <img src="WorkspaceLauncher.jpg">
       <p>

       Of course, the workspace name will have your user name in place
       of "thc."  You can choose whatever place you want for your
       workspace, but it's easiest to just use the default you're
       given.  I recommend that you just click the checkbox next to
       "Use this as the default and do not ask again" and then click
       "OK."
       
       <p>

  <li> You'll then see the following screen:
       
       <p>
       <img src="EclipseWelcome.jpg">
       <p>

       Click on the folded-over arrow on the right.  You won't see
       this screen again, even if you quit Eclipse and relaunch it.
       
       <p>

  <li> Now you'll see the following screen:

       <p>
       <img src="FirstWorkspace.jpg">
       <p>

       Lots of buttons and panes, but nothing of consequence.

       <p>

  <li> You have now installed Eclipse!

</ol>

<!-- GOT THIS FAR -->

<h2>How to configure Eclipse</h2>

You don't <em>have</em> to configure Eclipse so that it looks like how
I use it, but you'll probably avoid some confusion if you do so.
Here's how.

<ol start=12>

  <li> In the Eclipse menu bar, click on the Eclipse menu and then on
       "Preferences...".  You'll see a window with two panes.  On the
       left pane is a list of types of things you can configure.
       
       <p>

  <li> Click on the triangle to the left of "General."  Then click on
       the triangle to the left of "Appearance."  Then click on
       "Colors and Fonts."  You should see a window like this:
       
       <p>
       <img src="ColorsandFonts.jpg">
       <p>

  <li> In the window in the middle, click on the triangle next to
       "Java."  Then <em>double-click</em> on "Java Editor Text Font."
       
       <p>
       <img src="JavaEditorTextFont.jpg">
       <p>

       As you can see, there's some text following "Java Editor Text
       Font." Don't worry about it.

       <p>

  <li> The following window will pop up:
       
       <p>
       <img src="Fonts.jpg">
       <p>

       On the right, where you can select the size, click "12."  Then
       close this window by clicking on the window's close button.

       <p>

  <li> Close up the "General" preferences by clicking on the triangle
       to the left of "General."  Click the triangle next to "Java"
       and then click the triangle next to "Code Style."  Then click
       "Formatter."  Here's what you should see:

       <p>
       <img src="Formatter.jpg">
       <p>

  <li> Click the button that says "New...".  You'll see a window such
       as this one:
       
       <p>
       <img src="NewProfile.jpg">
       <p>
       
       You can type in any profile name you like.  I used "CS 5":
       
       <p>
       <img src="CS5Profile.jpg">
       <p>

       Then click "OK."
       
       <p>

  <li> You should see a window that looks like this:
              
       <p>
       <img src="InitCS5Profile.jpg">
       <p>

       Change the tab size to 2:

       <p>
       <img src="TabSize2.jpg">
       <p>

       You'll see that the Indentation size automatically changes as
       well.
       
       <p>

  <li> Click on "Blank Lines," and after "Between import groups" and
       "Before declarations of the same kind," change the values 1 to
       0:
              
       <p>
       <img src="BlankLines.jpg">
       <p>

  <li> Click on "Control Statements," and check the boxes as I've done
       here:
              
       <p>
       <img src="ControlStmts.jpg">
       <p>

       Click "OK."
       
       <p>

  <li> Now click on triangles to close up "Java."  Click on the
       triangle next to "Run/Debug," and then click on "Console."
              
       <p>
       <img src="Console.jpg">
       <p>

  <li> Click on the green color sample next to "Standard In text
       color." You'll get a color picker:
              
       <p>
       <img src="LightGreen.jpg">
       <p>

  <li> Slide the slider on the right down, so that you get a dark
       green.  (You're at Dartmouth. What other color could you
       possibly want?)
              
       <p>
       <img src="DarkGreen.jpg">
       <p>

       Close the color picker window by clicking its close button, and
       click "OK" again to close the Preferences window.

       <p>

  <li> Finally, I don't use the Task List and Outline panes, which are
       on the right-hand side of the window.  Click on the "X" next to
       "Task List" and next to "Outline" in the tabs of these panes:
              
       <p>
       <img src="ClosePanes.jpg">
       <p>

       You'll get something like this:
              
       <p>
       <img src="EclipseDone.jpg">
       <p>

       And you're done!

</ol>
