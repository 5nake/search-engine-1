D.C. Osipovitch, A.S. Parker, C.D. Makokha, J. Desrosiers, W.C. Kett, L. Moise, C. Bailey-Kellogg, and K.E. Griswold, "Design and analysis of immune-evading enzymes for ADEPT therapy", <i>Protein Eng. Des. Sel.</i>, 2012, 25:613-624. <a href="http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/10/613.long">[paper] </a><br class="clear" /><div id="abs"><p>The unparalleled specificity and activity of therapeutic proteins has reshaped many aspects of modern clinical practice, and aggressive development of new protein drugs promises a continued revolution in disease therapy.  As a result of their biological origins, however, therapeutic proteins present unique design challenges for the biomolecular engineer.  For example, protein drugs are subject to immune surveillance within the patient's body; this anti-drug immune response can compromise therapeutic efficacy and even threaten patient safety.  Thus, there is a growing demand for broadly applicable protein deimmunization strategies.  We have recently developed optimization algorithms that integrate computational prediction of T cell epitopes and bioinformatics-based assessment of the structural and functional consequences of epitope-deleting mutations.  Here, we describe the first experimental validation of our deimmunization algorithms using Enterobacter cloacae P99 beta-lactamase, a component of ADEPT cancer therapies.  Compared to wild-type or a previously deimmunized variant, our computationally optimized sequences exhibited significantly less in vitro binding to human MHC II immune molecules.  At the same time, our globally optimal design exhibited wild-type catalytic proficiency.  We conclude that our deimmunization algorithms guide the protein engineer towards promising immunoevasive candidates and thereby have the potential to streamline biotherapeutic development.  </p></div><div id="absimg"><img src="img/pub/peds12.png" alt="peds12.png" /></div><br class="clear" /></div>
