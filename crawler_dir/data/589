<h1>Installing Eclipse on Windows XP and Vista</h1>

This page tells you how to download Eclipse for Windows XP and Vista,
install it, and configure it so that it looks like how I use it.  If
you need help, Blitz <a
href="mailto:cs5help@cs.dartmouth.edu">cs5help@cs.dartmouth.edu</a>.

<h2> How to download and install Java </h2>

Your computer might or might not already have Java installed.  Before
you install Ecipse check to make sure you have Java.  The <a
href=http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp> official Java download
website </a> has a link to downloading Java, as well as one for
determining whether you have Java already.

<p>

If you aren't sure whether you have Java or not, you can download and
install Java anyway.  All the installer will do if you already have it
is upgrade it or tell you that you already have it.

<p>

Once you've installed (or checked that you already have) Java, it's
time to download and install Eclipse.

<h2>How to download and install Eclipse</h2>

<ol>
  
  <li> Go to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>
       to download a copy of eclipse.  The page will look like
       this:
       
       <p>
       <img src="EclipseDownloads.jpg">
       </p><p>

       The first item listed is "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (99
       MB)."  You (probably) want the 32-bit version, unless you have
       some reason to believe otherwise.  (The 32-bit version will
       work just fine even on a 64-bit windows computer.)
       
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> You will see the following window:
       
       <p>
       <img src="EclipseMirror.jpg">
       </p><p>

       Click on the green, downward pointing arrow.  A download of
       eclipse-java-helios-win32.zip will start. Save the file to a convenient location, like your Desktop.
       
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> Find
       eclipse-java-helios-win32.zip from wherever you saved it.  Then double-click it. It will open
		with the default windows extraction wizard or with an 
	   extraction tool like Winzip or Winrar.  You will
       see a folder named "eclipse."
	   
       <p>

  </p></li><li> Drag the "eclipse" folder into your "Program Files."  The
       easiest way to do so is to go to "Computer" (or "My Computer")--> "Local Disk (C:)" --> "Program Files" and
		drag the "eclipse" folder into the "Program Files" folder.  Make sure that you do <em>not</em> drag it into
       a folder that's already within "Program Files."  In other words,
       when you're done, the "Program Files" folder should have directly
       within it a folder named "eclipse." If Windows displays any dialog boxes asking for permission, click "allow" or "permit."

       <p>

  </p></li><li> (This step is not required, but it's strongly recommended.)
       Double click the "eclipse" folder.  You'll see an application
       named "Eclipse"; it has a purple icon with white horizontal
       stripes.  Right-click it and press "Send To" -> "Desktop (Create Shortcut)."  Now you will be able to
       launch Eclipse from your desktop.
       
       <p>

  </p></li><li> You may now drag eclipse-java-galileo-win32.zip to the
       "Recycle Bin."  Empty the "Recycle Bin" whenever you wish.
       
       <p>

  </p></li>
  
  <li> Go ahead and open up Eclipse. You'll see something like the following window:
       
       <p>
       <img src="WorkspaceLauncher.jpg">
       </p><p>

       Of course, the workspace name will have your user name in place
       of "Zach."  You can choose whatever place you want for your
       workspace, but it's easiest to just use the default you're
       given.  I recommend that you just click the checkbox next to
       "Use this as the default and do not ask again" and then click
       "OK."
       
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> You'll then see the following screen:
       
       <p>
       <img src="EclipseWelcome.jpg">
       </p><p>

       Click on the folded-over arrow on the right.  You'll see the
       tooltip on the above screen when you move the mouse over the
       arrow.  You won't see this screen again, even if you quit
       Eclipse and relaunch it.
       
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> Now you'll see the following screen:

       <p>
       <img src="FirstWorkspace.jpg">
       </p><p>

       Lots of buttons and panes, but nothing of consequence.

       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> You have now installed Eclipse!

</li></ol>

<h2>How to configure Eclipse</h2>

You don't <em>have</em> to configure Eclipse so that it looks like how
I use it, but you'll probably avoid some confusion if you do so.
Here's how.

<ol start="12">

  <li> In the Eclipse menu bar, click on the "Window" menu and then on
       "Preferences."  You'll see a window with two panes.  On the
       left pane is a list of types of things you can configure.
       
       <p>

  </p></li><li> Click on the plus sign to the left of "General."  Then click on
       the plus sign to the left of "Appearance."  Then click on
       "Colors and Fonts."  You should see a window like this:
       
       <p>
       <img src="ColorsandFonts.jpg">
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> In the window in the middle, click on the plus sign next to
       "Java."  Then <em>double-click</em> on "Java Editor Text Font."
       
       <p>
       <img src="JavaEditorTextFont.jpg">
       </p><p>

       As you can see, there's some text following "Java Editor Text
       Font." Don't worry about it.

       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> The following window will pop up:
       
       <p>
       <img src="Fonts.jpg">
       </p><p>

       On the right, where you can select the size, click "12."  Then
       close this window by clicking on the ok button.

       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> Close up the "General" preferences by clicking on the minus sign
       to the left of "General."  Click the plus sign next to "Java"
       and then click the plus sign next to "Code Style."  Then click
       "Formatter."  Here's what you should see:

       <p>
       <img src="Formatter.jpg">
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> Click the button that says "New...".  You'll see a window such
       as this one:
       
       <p>
       <img src="NewProfile.jpg">
       </p><p>
       
       You can type in any profile name you like.  I used "CS 5":
       
       </p><p>
       <img src="CS5Profile.jpg">
       </p><p>

       Then click "OK."
       
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> You should see a window that looks like this:
              
       <p>
       <img src="InitCS5Profile.jpg">
       </p><p>

       Change the tab size to 2:

       </p><p>
       <img src="TabSize2.jpg">
       </p><p>

       You'll see that the Indentation size automatically changes as
       well.
       
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> Click on "Blank Lines," and after "Between import groups" and
       "Before declarations of the same kind," change the values 1 to
       0:
              
       <p>
       <img src="BlankLines.jpg">
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> Click on "Control Statements," and check the boxes as I've done
       here:
              
       <p>
       <img src="ControlStmts.jpg">
       </p><p>

       Click "OK."
       
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> Now click on minus sign to close up "Java."  Click on the
       plus sign next to "Run/Debug," and then click on "Console."
              
       <p>
       <img src="Console.jpg">
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> Click on the green color sample next to "Standard In text
       color." You'll get a color picker:
              
       <p>
       <img src="DarkGreen.jpg">
       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> Click on the box with the Darker Green  (You're at Dartmouth. What other color could you
       possibly want?)
        <p>

       Close the color picker window by clicking "OK", and
       click "OK" again to close the Preferences window.

       </p><p>

  </p></li><li> Finally, I don't use the Task List and Outline panes, which are
       on the right-hand side of the window.  Click on the "X" next to
       "Task List" and next to "Outline" in the tabs of these panes:
              
       <p>
       <img src="ClosePanes.jpg">
       </p><p>

       You'll get something like this:
              
       </p><p>
       <img src="EclipseDone.jpg">
       </p><p>

       And you're done!

</p></li></ol>
