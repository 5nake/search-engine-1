    The open round for 2013 has concluded. The
  solutions are being graded, and scores will be available in a few
  weeks. Stay tuned in case you qualify for the invitational on March
  19th.<p>

    If you missed the chance to participate, check back
    towards the end of this year for details on the 2014 olympiad.<p>

<a name="what"></a> <h3>What is NACLO?</h3>
  NACLO is a computational linguistics olympiad for students in grades
  6-12 studying in North America. It is a written test containing
  linguistic puzzles. Students take the test individually. There are
  two rounds of the competition. The first is an open round; those who
  do well on it will be invited to compete in the second
  'invitational' round. The top performing students from the US and
  Canada are then selected to represent their countries in the
  International Linguistics Olympiad, which will be held in
  Manchester, UK this year.<p>

  Here is a sample puzzle from one of the previous years.<p>

  <img src="sampleproblem.jpg" width="600px"><p>

  The solution does not require any knowledge of Swahili! Here's how you
  may go about it:

  <ol>
<li> Since "tarehe" occurs in all the examples (it probably means
    "date" or some such) we can ignore it.

   <li>The similarity of "Disemba", "Aprili", and "Oktoba" with the
   English words for the months is a good indicator of what they
   are. But you don't need to rely on this similarity. Notice that "Aprili"
   occurs in two examples, as does "April" in the English set,
   "Disemba" and "December" both occur once, and "Oktoba" and
   "October" three times.

    <li>"tano" occurs in all the October phrases, so it must correspond
    to the 5th. From this, we can also infer than the second word in
    the Swahili phrases is the numerical date. So "tatu" is 3, and
    "pili" and "nne" are 2 or 4, but it's not yet clear which is which.

    <li>The last word in the phrases must therefore denote the day of
    the week. However, note that it contains the numbers
    ("juma<b>tano</b>", etc.) that occur at the beginning of the phrases. It is therefore likely that the Swahili days
    of the week are denoted by numbers -- the question is, what is the
    correspondence between the Swahili numbers and the English days?<p>
    
   "jumanne" in April is obviously Tuesday. Since "nne" is either 2 or
   4, this means Monday is either day 1 or day 3.<p>

   But looking at the October phrases, it is clear that the word for
    Monday has to be either "jumapili", "jumatatu", or
    "jumatano". We know that none of the three can be the word for day 1
    (since "pili" is 2 or 4, "tatu" is 3, and "tano" is 5). So the
    only possibility is that Monday is day 3 ("jumatatu"), and consequently,
    "nne" is 4, "pili" is 2, "jumapili" is Sunday, "jumatano" is
    Wednesday, and since Saturday is day 1, "mosi" must be the word for 1.
    </ol>    
  

<a name="where"></a> <h3>Where is it held?</h3>

  The Dartmouth test site, serving students in and around the Upper
  Valley region of New Hampshire and Vermont, will be on the Dartmouth
  College campus in Hanover, NH at the <a href="directions.html" target="_blank">Haldeman</a> Center, Room 031.
  <p>
  
  If you do not live near the Hanover area, you may want to check out the other university and high school sites across North America,
  <a href="http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/sites.php" target="_blank">listed here</a>. Sites within a few hours of Dartmouth include Boston, Schenectady, and Montreal.

 <a name="when"></a> <h3>When does it take place?</h3>
The open round will begin at 10 am EST on Jan 31, 2013. Plan to arrive at the venue 45 minutes before the test (and even earlier if you haven't pre-registered). You must be seated by 9:40 am.
  
<a name="how"></a> <h3>How can I participate?</h3>
Interested students should register at the 
  <a href="http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/reg_student.php" target="_blank">
  NACLO registration page</a>, and select Dartmouth as the test location. Registration is free! You may also register onsite
  during the test day at Dartmouth, but advanced registration (preferably before Jan 15) is
  encouraged. <p>

  <a name="prepare"></a> <h3>What should I do to prepare?</h3>
  You do not need any background in linguistics or computational linguistics -- just enthusiasm for problem-solving and puzzles. The test can be reasonably challenging, so we encourage you to practice solving some <a href="http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/practice.html">problems from previous contests</a>.<p>
  
  Aan information session is going to be held at Dartmouth for
 interested students on January 18 (Friday) at 4:30 pm at Haldeman
 125. (This is the same building where the open round will take place,
 but a different classroom.) We will go over sample questions and problem-solving strategies, and discuss the study of linguistics, computer science, and computational linguistics in college. You are welcome to attend even if you do not intend to take part in NACLO.<p>
