<h3>Text</h3>
<UL>
<LI>
        <EM>Concepts in Programming Languages</EM> <br>
        by John Mitchell<br>
        Available at the Dartmouth Bookstore and Wheelock Books.</LI>

</UL>




<h3> Grades </h3>
The final grade will be determined based on weekly problem sets (written
and programming) a midterm, a final exam, and a project involving Python.  
<ul>
<li>Homeworks: 50%
<li>Midterm: 20%
<li>Final: 20%
<li>Project: 10%
</ul>

The midterm will be 7:00 on May 9 in 006 Kemeney.<br>
The final will be 3:00 on June 5.
<!--
Homework problems will be graded on the following scale:
<ul>
<li> <b> 5 </b> Outstanding.  Especially elegant or clever solution or
exceptionally clear justification and writeup.  I don't expect to give
out many 5's.
<li> <b> 4 </b>  Good.   The answer is basically correct and clearly presented,
but is not special.
<li> <b> 3 </b>  OK.  Got the basic idea, but either some details are wrong
or the presentation is not clear.
<li> <b> 2 </b> Poor.  Something of value, but below the standard that I
expect.
<li> <b> 1 </b> You tried, but this is not passing work.
</ul>
-->



<h3>Late Homeworks </h3>
Homework is due at class time on the due date.  Late homework
will loose 20% if handed in by the next class, 40% if handed in
by the class following that, and will not be accepted later.

<h3>Honor Code</h3>
<UL>
<LI>All work submitted for credit must be your own.</LI>
<LI>You may discuss the homework problems with your classmates
    and the instructor. You must acknowledge
    the people with whom you discussed your work, and you must write
    up your own solutions.  Any written sources used (apart from the text)
    must also be acknowledged.</LI>
<LI>Exam problems may only be discussed with the instructor.</LI>
<LI>Please ask if you have any questions about the honor code as it
    applies to CS 68.</LI>
</UL>

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
I encourage students
with disabilities, including &quot;invisible&quot; disabilities
such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss with
me any appropriate accommodations that I might make on their
behalf.<br>
