<h2>Course Description </h2>
	<p>
    Computer science focuses on solving problems with a computer.  
    Given a problem, we like to know <em>is it solvable?</em>
    If it is, <em>how?</em>
    Once we have a method, we ask <em>does it work correctly?</em>
    If so, <em>how long does it take?</em>  
    When we have measured that, we ask <em>but can we do it faster?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    To answer these questions, we need to know what these words mean:
    What does it mean to be <em>solvable</em>?  
    How can we prove that, anyway?  
    What is a <em>method</em>, and how do we measure how <em>long</em> something takes?  
    We need to know <em>discrete mathematics</em>.  
  </p>

  <p>
    One purpose of this course is for you to become comfortable
    with mathematical thinking and writing
    clean, logical, proofs.  
    You will also learn about probability, combinatorics (counting), some 
    graph theory, enough number theory to understand how RSA Public Key encryption works,
    and similar mathematical topics that are important for 
    students who want to understand computer science.
    <!-- Throughout, we maintain a computational view by
    illustrating abstract notions with concrete real-world examples. -->
  </p>

<h2>Lectures</h2>

X-hour is Tuesday 12:00-12:50pm.

<h2>X-hours</h2>
<p>
I expect to use all x-hours.
Please make sure that you have no other engagements during X-hours.

<h2>Keeping up</h2>
Avoid falling behind in this class.   If  things are not making sense, please come
to office hours to get help.  Topics build on one another, so don't
think that you can get behind and catch up later.  You will find that the next
topic may not make sense.

<h2>Homework</h2>

There will be weekly homework assignments.  They usually go out on
a Friday and are due in class one week later; the first homework will be
assigned on Friday, January 11.  
A few points about the homework assignments:

<dl>
<dt><b>General Advice</b> </dt>
<dd>
Start early.
Difficult problems are not typically solved in one sitting.  
Start early and let the ideas come to you over the course of a few days.

Use good mathematical notation to be rigorous and concise.
</dd>

<dt><b>Study Groups</b></dt>
<dd>
Some problems could be difficult and it might be helpful to discuss them with
others.  Feel free to form study groups.  The idea, however, is for
<em>everyone</em> to understand the problems and experience
working through the solutions.  So you should not simply "give"
a solution to another classmate.  In particular, each student
should write up his or her own homework solutions and should
not read or copy the solutions of others.
For each problem, if you worked on that problem with anyone,
you should write down their names at the start of the solution to that problem.
If you receive help from the professor or the TA, be sure to acknowledge their names also.
</dd>

<dt><b>Work on your own before talking to others</b> </dt>
<dd>
Although, as I said above, you can work with others on the homework problems,
you will learn the most by first trying out each problem on your own.
Make as much progress as possible on your own before you meet with your
study group.  If you get used to working with others and
often don't come up with the solutions on your own,
you may do okay in the homework component of your grade,
but you will suffer in the exams where you are entirely on your own.
</dd>

<li><strong>Extra Credit problems:</strong>
<dd>
In some homeworks, I might assign extra credit problems.  I will keep track of
extra credit points separately from regular points, and at the end of the term I 
will use them to resolve borderline grades.
If your grade is on the border and you have done substantial amount of extra credit and have done it well,
then and only then will the extra credit points be of help with respect to the grade.
I therefore encourage you to work on challenge problems
only after you have solved the regular problems as well as you possibly can,
and if you enjoy the additional challenge.  You cannot "make up" for missing
regular homework by doing extra credit.
</dd>

<dt><b>Homework Lateness Policy</b></dt>
<dd>
Homework is due at the <i>beginning of class </i> on the announced due date (usually Wednesday).
Late homework has an immediate 20% penalty (unless there is a valid excuse which,
which if possible you should discuss with me at least two days in advance),
and 10% penalty per calendar day after that.
I will not accept a homework after the next homework is due, or after the final.
In this course, if you don't do your homework on time, you will soon find yourself overwhelmed, 
so please be regular with your work.
</dd>

<!--
You may submit any homework, except the last one, one 
      <em>class day</em> late for a 10% penalty.  A class day is the
      next day we have a lecture.  Generally, this means that you may 
      submit a homework by Friday 10 am.  After that, you have an 
      automatic zero.
</dd>

<dt><b>Late Days</b></dt>
<dd>
      You get two free late days, meaning that you will not get the
      10% penalty on the first two homeoworks you turn late.  
      Of course, you may not use both late days at the same time, given the late
      policy, and you may not use one for the last homework.  
      The late days are for special occasions, such as when you are
      sick, overworked, have too many midterms, and so on.
Use them wisely:  You will not get any more!
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Exams</h2>
There will be two midterm exams and a final exam; all are closed-book, in-class exams.
<ul>
<li> First midterm: 7:00-9:00pm Tuesday, February 5; Location: LSC 200 (our regular classroom) </li>
<li> Second midterm: 7:00:9:00pm Tuesday, February 26; Location: LSC 200 (our regular classroom) </li>
<li> Final Exam: 8.00-10.00am Monday, March 11; Location : LSC 200 (our regular classroom)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Review Session</h2>
Before the final exam, we will have a review session 10:00-11:30am Sunday,
March 10; Location: LSC 200 (our regular classroom)

<h2>Grading</h2>
<ul>
<li> Homework: 40%
<li> Midterm 1: 20%
<li> Midterm 2: 20%
<li> Final: 20%
</ul>

<!--
<h2>Homework/Exam Regrade</h2>
Your work is normally graded by the graduate TA and the grader.
If you have any questions on how a particular problem is graded, you should see Ye during his office hours and explain the concern.
He will keep your homework/exam, consult with the appropriate grader, and then get back to you.
If you have any grading questions, you must see Ye within a week after your homework/exam is returned.
Regrading won't be done if you approach him later.
-->

<h2>Honor Code</h2>
<strong>All work submitted for credit must be your own.</strong>
You may discuss the homework problems with your classmates, the
TAs, or Professor Jayanti,  but you must write up your own
solutions.  For each problem, you must indicate who else you worked
with or got any help from, small or big.  Even if you worked with the same people on the entire
assignment, be sure to write their names at the start of the solution of each problem.
Any written sources used (apart from the text, your notes and any
homework solutions that I distribute) must also be
acknowledged; however, <em>you may not consult any
solutions on the internet or from previous years' assignments, whether they are student- or faculty-generated.</em>

<p>

The rules are different for the exams.
The exams are closed book and you may not discuss the problems with anyone.

<p>
You should consult a copy of Dartmouth's <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~writing/sources/">Sources and Citations</a>.

<p>
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/acad-honor.html">Dartmouth's Academic Honor Principle</a> 
applies to this course.
Please be sure to read it.

<p>
Please ask me if you have any questions about the honor code as it
applies to CS 30.  Better safe than sorry!

<h2>Disabilities</h2>

Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may
need disability-related accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment
to see me on or before Friday, January 18.
All discussions will remain confidential, although the
Student Accessibility Services office may be consulted
to discuss appropriate implementation of any accommodation requested.

<h2>Religious Observances</h2>

Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during
this acdemic term.  If you have a religious observance that conflicts with
your participation in the course, please meet with me
on or before Friday, January 18 to discuss appropriate accommodations.
